The error message `値は型character varying(50)としては長すぎます` translates to "value is too long for type character varying(50)", which indicates that one of the values you're trying to insert into the database exceeds the column length limit of 50 characters.

Here’s how you can address this issue:

### 1. **Check Database Schema**

Verify the length constraints for the columns in your `users` table. Specifically, check the columns `username`, `password`, and `email` to see if any of them have a maximum length of 50 characters.

For example, you might have a table definition like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  username VARCHAR(50),
  email VARCHAR(50),
  password VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### 2. **Update Database Schema**

If the column lengths are too short for your needs, you can increase them. You can alter the table to expand the length of the columns. For example:

```sql
ALTER TABLE users
ALTER COLUMN username TYPE VARCHAR(100),
ALTER COLUMN email TYPE VARCHAR(100),
ALTER COLUMN password TYPE VARCHAR(100);
```
